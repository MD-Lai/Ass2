Submission Notes
**************
* Milestones *
**************
+ for accomplished
* for in progress
- for dropped or likely to be left unimplemented
# for new ideas

  Key features
+ Keyboard/mouse input
+ accelerometer/touch input
+ Have a ball interact with the plane in the appropriate manner
+ Render a board with randomly placed walls with no texture
+ Properly implement DFS and have the walls placed accordingly
+ Textured and bump mapped rendering of the board and walls
- Specular metallic rendering of the ball
+ bump-map rendering of ball
+ Camera controls and ability to re-center on the ball
+ "Maze complete" state
+ create a new maze
+ Game UI

  Sub-key features
- Glass refraction and place a glass plane on top of the box
- Cubemap reflection for ball (subsituted for bump mapping and rim shading for main ball)
- Reactive lighting (i.e. in game light proportional to light sensor)
- Real time shadows 
- Animated rearrangement of maze
- Easter eggs and other ideas that pop up along the way

  Summary
+ The foundations of the gameplay is set, and most interactive elements are complete 
+ or will be relatively quick to complete.
+ The presentation will be based on showing the base "gameplay" with no regard of the graphics component
+ just interaction. 
+ After the initial submission date, there will be no more submissions due and so it'll be 100% graphics 100% of the time.
